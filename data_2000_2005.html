        <p><h5><i>The average U.S. temperature increased by approximately 1°F (0.6°C) from 1901 to 2000, with significant warming observed in the early 21st century. The years 2001-2005 were consistently among the warmest on record.
            •  CO2 Emissions: In 2005, U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion reached about 6 billion metric tons, a 1.2% increase from 2004, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
            •  Global Emissions: The U.S. was responsible for approximately 25% of global CO2 emissions during this period, although its share began to decline as emissions from developing countries rose.
            Heat Waves: The summer of 2003 saw one of the hottest years on record for many parts of the U.S., with temperature anomalies exceeding 10°F (5.5°C) in some regions.
