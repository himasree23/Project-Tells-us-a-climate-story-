        <p><h5><i>The IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report, confirming that climate change was largely driven by human activities. It stated that the average global temperature had risen about 0.8Â°C

            The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that 2005 was one of the hottest years on record, and 2009 also saw significant temperature increases
            Greenhouse Gas Emissions
            1.	Emissions Trends: In 2009, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions dropped to approximately 6,700 million metric tons CO2 equivalent, reflecting economic downturns during the Great Recession. However, emissions were still higher than in the early 2000s.
            2.	Sector Contributions: Emissions from the electricity sector remained the largest source, followed by transportation and industry. Efforts to shift towards renewable energy began to gain momentum during this period.
            Greenhouse Gas Emissions
            1.	Total Emissions:
            o	In 2005, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 7,260 million metric tons CO2 equivalent.
            2.	CO2 Emissions:
            o	In 2005, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion were about 6 billion metric tons.
            o	By 2009, CO2 emissions had decreased to around 5.3 billion metric tons.</i></h5>
